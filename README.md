ContinousCheck&Email.py is the main code file for the app


this is meant to copy the functions of app signal to reduce the monthly payment cost of using AppSignal:
track errors, monitor performance, and detect anomalies in their applications.

the app has a list of ssh id to access all log files and monitor them,
currently the app is set to email once an error is detected and send it to me.

the ssh id's and email have been hardcoded.
